# AutoGluon Kaggle Demos ‚Äî Academic Edition

This repository contains two fast, reproducible **AutoGluon Tabular** workflows demonstrating how to build, train, and submit models to Kaggle competitions directly from Google Colab.

Each notebook focuses on **clarity, speed, and reproducibility** rather than leaderboard optimization, making them ideal for academic presentations or portfolio demonstrations.
